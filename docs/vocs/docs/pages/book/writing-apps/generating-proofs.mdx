# Generating Proofs

Generating a proof using the CLI is simple - first generate a key, then generate your proof. Using command defaults, this looks like:

```bash
cargo openvm keygen         # generate proving and verification keys for app proofs
cargo openvm prove app      # generate the app proof

cargo openvm setup          # generate proving and verification keys for STARK aggregation
cargo openvm prove stark    # generate the STARK proof

cargo openvm setup --evm    # generate proving and verification keys for EVM proofs
cargo openvm prove evm      # generate the EVM proof
```

## Application Key Generation

The `keygen` command generates both an application proving and verification key.

```bash
cargo openvm keygen --config <path_to_app_config>
```

Similarly to `build`, `run`, and `prove`, options `--manifest-path`, `--target-dir`, and `--output-dir` are provided.

If `--config` is not specified, the command will search for `openvm.toml` in the manifest directory. If the file isn't found, a default configuration will be used.

The proving and verification key will be written to `${target_dir}/openvm/` (and `--output-dir` if specified).

## Generating App Commitments

Once you have built the guest program and generated an app proving key, you can extract commitments to the program binary and
the VM configuration using the following CLI command:

```bash
cargo openvm commit
    --app-pk <path_to_app_pk>
    --exe <path_to_transpiled_program>
```

This will generate a `*.commit.json` file in `${target_dir}/openvm/${profile}/` (and `--output-dir` if specified) containing:

- `app_exe_commit`: A commitment to the OpenVM program binary.
- `app_vm_commit`: A commitment to the OpenVM configuration used for the program binary.

These values will be used later when verifying proofs generated by OpenVM for this program.

Note if `--app-pk` is not provided, the command will search for a proving key at `${target_dir}/openvm/app.pk`. If `--exe` is not provided, the command will call `build` before generating the commits. Many of the Cargo options available to `cargo openvm run` are available to `commit` too, for more information on the available options see [Run Flags](/book/writing-apps/running-a-program#run-flags).

## STARK and EVM Key Generation

The `setup` command generates proving and verification keys for STARK aggregation and EVM proofs.

```bash
cargo openvm setup [--evm]
```

If called without the `--evm` flag, it will generate keys for the leaf, internal, and root STARK
verifiers as detailed in the [specs](/specs/architecture/continuations). If called with the `--evm`
flag, it will also generate keys for the [static verifier wrapper](/specs/architecture/continuations#static-verifier-wrapper).

### Details on EVM Verification

In addition to generating EVM proving and verification keys, `cargo openvm setup --evm` also
generates a smart contract verifier for EVM chains. Upon a successful run, the command will write the files

- `agg_stark.pk`
- `agg_stark.vk`
- `root.asm`
- `agg_halo2.pk`
- `halo2/src/[OPENVM_VERSION]/Halo2Verifier.sol`
- `halo2/src/[OPENVM_VERSION]/OpenVmHalo2Verifier.sol`
- `halo2/src/[OPENVM_VERSION]/interfaces/IOpenVmHalo2Verifier.sol`
- `halo2/src/[OPENVM_VERSION]/verifier.bytecode.json`
- `params/`

to `~/.openvm/`, where `~` is the directory specified by environment variable `$HOME` and 
`OPENVM_VERSION` is the version of OpenVM. Every command that requires these files will 
look for them in this directory. The smart contract verifier is also available via the
[OpenVM Solidity SDK](/book/writing-apps/solidity-sdk) for released versions of OpenVM.

The files `agg_stark.pk` and `agg_halo2.pk` are the STARK and Halo2 aggregation proving keys necessary to aggregate to a final EVM proof.
The file `agg_stark.vk` is the STARK aggregation verification key.
The file `root.asm` contains instructions to verify STARK proofs.
The `params` directory contains various trusted setup KZG parameters needed to guarantee Halo2's cryptographic security.
The `OpenVmHalo2Verifier.sol` file contains a Solidity contract to verify the final EVM proof. The contract is named `OpenVmHalo2Verifier` and it implements the `IOpenVmHalo2Verifier` interface.

```solidity [IOpenVmHalo2Verifier.sol]
interface IOpenVmHalo2Verifier {
    function verify(bytes calldata publicValues, bytes calldata proofData, bytes32 appExeCommit, bytes32 appVmCommit)
        external
        view;
}
```

In addition, the command outputs a JSON file `verifier.bytecode.json` of the form

```json [verifier.bytecode.json]
{
    "sol_compiler_version": "0.8.19",
    "sol_compiler_options": "..",
    "bytecode": ".."
}
```

where `sol_compiler_version` is the Solidity compiler version used to compile the contract (currently `0.8.19`),
`sol_compiler_options` are additional compiler options used, and
`bytecode` is the compiled EVM bytecode as a hex string (without the `0x` prefix).

:::note
Note that `cargo openvm setup --evm` downloads auxiliary files for halo2 KZG parameters from an AWS S3 bucket into `~/.openvm/`.

:::warning
If the `$HOME` environment variable is not set, this command may fail. This command requires a large amount of compute and memory (~70 GB) and can take ~7mins on a `m6a.16xlarge` instance.

## Proof Generation

The `prove` CLI command, at its core, uses the options below. `prove` gets access to all of the options that `run` has (see [Running a Program](/book/writing-apps/running-a-program) for more information).

```bash
cargo openvm prove [app | stark | evm]
    --app-pk <path_to_app_pk>
    --exe <path_to_transpiled_program>
    --input <path_to_input>
    --proof <path_to_proof_output>
```

If `--app-pk` is not provided, the command will search for a proving key at `${target_dir}/openvm/app.pk`.

If `--exe` is not provided, the command will call `build` before generating a proof.

If your program doesn't require inputs, you can (and should) omit the `--input` flag.

If `--proof` is not provided then the command will write the proof to `./${bin_name}.[app | stark | evm].proof` by default, where `bin_name` is the file stem of the executable run.

The `app` subcommand generates an application-level proof, the `stark` command generates an aggregated root-level proof, while the `evm` command generates an end-to-end EVM proof. For more information on aggregation, see [the specification](/specs/architecture/continuations). See [Verifying EVM Proofs](/book/writing-apps/verifying-proofs#verifying-evm-proofs) for details on the output format for `cargo openvm prove evm`.

:::warning
The `stark` subcommand requires STARK aggregation key generation to have been run via
`cargo openvm setup`, and the `evm` subcommand requires EVM key generation to have been run via
`cargo openvm setup --evm`, which has a large compute and memory requirement (~70 GB).

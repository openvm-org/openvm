# Using the SDK

While the CLI provides a convenient way to build, prove, and verify programs, you may want more fine-grained control over the process. The OpenVM Rust SDK allows you to customize various aspects of the workflow programmatically.

For more information on the basic CLI flow, see [Overview of Basic Usage](/book/writing-apps/overview). Writing a guest program is the same as in the CLI.

## Imports and Setup

If you have a guest program and would like to try running the **host program** specified in the next section, you can do so by adding the following imports and setup at the top of the file. You may need to modify the imports and/or the `SomeStruct` struct to match your program.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:dependencies]
```

## Configuring the VM

### Preset Configurations

The following convenience methods are available to construct a `GenericSdk` object with a preset config:

- `Sdk::riscv32()` returns a `GenericSdk` supporting the RV32IM extension.
- `Sdk::standard()` returns a `GenericSdk` supporting all default OpenVM extensions, including RV32IM.

Note that to use `Sdk::riscv32()` or `Sdk::standard()` the `app_vm_config` field of your `openvm.toml` must exactly match a specific set configuration.

`Sdk::riscv32()` supports normal Rust compiled to the `rv32im` target (for more information see [OpenVM Rust Frontend](/specs/reference/rust-frontend)) and `openvm::io` functions. To use it, the `app_vm_config` field of your `openvm.toml` must be:

```toml [openvm_riscv32.toml]
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk_toml/openvm_riscv32.toml]
```

`Sdk::standard()` supports a wider variety of VM extensions, increasing the performance of many cryptographic operations. The `app_vm_config` section of the `openvm.toml` of any guest program that uses `Sdk::standard()` must also match a specific preset configuration.

<summary> Click here to view the `Sdk::standard()` `openvm.toml`</summary>
```toml [openvm_standard.toml]
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk_toml/openvm_standard.toml]
```
</details>

Observe that this standard `openvm.toml` also enables normal Rust and `openvm::io` functions (via the `rv32i`, `rv32m`, and `io` extensions). `keccak` and `sha256` enable intrinsic instructions for the [Keccak](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/keccak) and [SHA-256](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/sha-256) hashes respectively, and `bigint` supports [Big Integer](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/big-integer) operations.

[Modular](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/algebra) operations for the BN254, Secp256k1 (i.e. K256), Secp256r1 (i.e. P256), and BLS12-381 curves' scalar and coordinate field moduli are also supported, as well as [Complex Field Extension](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/algebra#complex-field-extension) operations over the BN254 and BLS12-381 coordinate fields. [Elliptic Curve Cryptography](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/elliptic-curve-cryptography) operations are also supported for the BN254, Secp256k1, Secp256r1, and BLS12-381 curves, and [Elliptic Curve Pairing](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/elliptic-curve-pairing) checks are supported for the BN254 and BLS12-381 curves.

For more information on extensions and guest libraries, see [Acceleration Using Pre-Built Extensions](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/overview).

### Customizing the VM Configuration

To use a custom VM configuration, you can construct your own `GenericSdk` object which includes the
extensions and system configuration your VM will use. To do this, you can use the `SdkVmConfig::builder()`
 method and set the desired extensions and system configuration as in the example below.

```rust
    let vm_config = SdkVmConfig::builder()
        .system(Default::default())
        .rv32i(Default::default())
        .rv32m(Default::default())
        .io(Default::default())
        .build()
        .optimize();
    let sdk = Sdk::new(
        AppConfig::new(FriParameters::standard_fast(), vm_config)
    )?;
```

A custom OpenVM configuration can also be specified in an `openvm.toml` file and read to create a `GenericSdk`.

```rust
    Sdk::new(Sdk::from_toml(openvm.toml))
```

:::info
When using Rust to write the guest program, the VM system configuration should keep the default value `pointer_max_bits = 29` to match the hardcoded memory limit of the memory allocator. Otherwise, the guest program may fail due to out of bounds memory access in the VM.
:::

## Building and Transpiling a Program

The SDK provides lower-level control over the building and transpiling process.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:build]
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:read_elf]

// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:transpilation]
```

## Running a Program

To run your program and see the public value output, you can do the following:

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:execution]
```

### Using `StdIn`

The `StdIn` struct allows you to format any serializable type into a VM-readable format by passing in a reference to your struct into `StdIn::write` as above. You also have the option to pass in a `&[u8]` into `StdIn::write_bytes`, or a `&[F]` into `StdIn::write_field` where `F` is the `openvm_stark_sdk::p3_baby_bear::BabyBear` field type.

:::info
**Generating CLI Bytes**
To get the VM byte representation of a serializable struct `data` (i.e. for use in the CLI), you can print out the result of `openvm::serde::to_vec(data).unwrap()` in a Rust host program.

## Generating and Verifying Proofs

OpenVM supports generating three types of proofs. The sections below describe how to generate and verify each type of proof.

- [App Proof](#app-proof): Generates STARK proof(s) of the guest program
- [STARK Proof](#stark-proof): Generates a STARK proof that can be posted on-chain
- [EVM Proof](#evm-proof): Generates a halo2 proof that can be posted on-chain

## App Proof

### Generating App Proofs

After building and transpiling a program, you can then generate a proof. To do so, you need to convert your ELF into a `VmExe`, commit your `VmExe`, generate an `AppProvingKey`, format your input into `StdIn`, and then generate a proof.

The SDK, however, combines the first few steps for you. Create a prover and pass in your input as a `StdIn` to generate an app proof.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_app.rs:proof_generation]
```

For large guest programs, the program will be proved in multiple continuation segments and the returned `proof: ContinuationVmProof` object consists of multiple STARK proofs, one for each segment.

:::info
The app prover constructor can take an `Elf`, `VmExe`, `Arc<VmExe>`, or raw ELF bytes in the form of a `Vec<u8>` or `&[u8]` (via implementations of the `From` trait). This also holds for the STARK and EVM provers specified below.
:::

### Verifying App Proofs

After generating a proof, you can verify it. To do so, you need your verifying key (which you can get from `sdk.app_keygen()`) and the output of your `prove` call.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_app.rs:verification]
```

<details>
<summary>To use the above verification, you may need additional dependencies. Click here to view.</summary>

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_app.rs:dependencies]
```

</details>

## STARK Proof

### Setup

To generate a STARK proof, you first need to generate proving and verification keys for STARK aggregation using the following CLI command:

```bash
cargo openvm setup
```

### STARK Proof Generation and Verification

You can now run the aggregation keygen, proof, and verification functions for the STARK proof by either (a) calling `sdk.prove(...)` directly or (b) creating a prover with custom fields. You should also generate an app commit, e.g. hashes of both the app config and executable used to generate the proof.

```rust 
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:proof_generation]
```

Once the proof is generated, you can verify it using the SDK as follows:

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_stark.rs:verification]
```

Note that STARK verification requires the app commit to confirm that the submitted proof is for the app config and executable specified.

## EVM Proof

### Setup

To generate an EVM proof, you'll first need to ensure that you have followed the [CLI installation steps](/book/getting-started/install)
to generate proving and verification keys for EVM proving.

```bash
cargo openvm setup --evm
```

:::warning
`cargo openvm setup --evm` requires a large amount of computation and memory (~70 GB).
:::

<details>
<summary>Also note that there are additional dependencies for the EVM Proof flow. Click here to view.</summary>

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_evm.rs:dependencies]
```

</details>

### EVM Proof Generation and Verification

You can now run the aggregation keygen, proof, and verification functions for the EVM proof.

**Note**: you **do not** need to generate the app proof with the `generate_app_proof` function, as the EVM proof function will handle this automatically.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_evm.rs:evm_verification]
```

:::warning
The halo2 aggregation proving key `agg_halo2.pk` used in the above example is large. Avoid cloning it if possible.
:::

Note that `DEFAULT_PARAMS_DIR` is the directory where Halo2 parameters are stored by the `cargo openvm setup --evm` CLI command. For more information on the setup process, see the `EVM Level` section of the [verify](/book/writing-apps/verifying-proofs) doc.

## Another Example: Using the Standard SDK

For many programs with modular arithmetic and/or cryptographic operations, the RISC-V instruction set alone may not be enough to achieve the performance desired. OpenVM supports many extensions to accelerate said operations, a standard set of which are included inside the standard SDK configuration.

Take, for example, this toy program that checks if several guest library implementations of [`IntMod`](/book/acceleration-using-extensions/algebra#available-traits-and-methods) are fields by loosely checking if their moduli are prime.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk_guest/little/src/main.rs]
```

Its `openvm.toml` follows the [preset configuration](/book/advanced-usage/sdk#preset-configurations) specified above.

Simply initialize `Sdk` using `Sdk::standard()` and build, prove, and verify as above.

```rust
// [!include ~/snippets/examples_sdk/sdk_app.rs:init]
```

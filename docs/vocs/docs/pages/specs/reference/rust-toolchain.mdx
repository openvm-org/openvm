# OpenVM Rust Toolchain

OpenVM supports a Rust frontend via compilation to a 32-bit RISC-V target which is
then transpiled into an OpenVM executable with instructions from the RV32IM VM extension.
We implement this by **cross-compiling** for a machine architecture which differs from the machine performing the build. This involves the following:

- **Host**: The machine architecture and compiler toolchain used to run the
program build and proving binary. 
- **Guest**: The machine architecture and compiler toolchain used to build the
program to be proven.

We detail the host and guest toolchains used for the Rust frontend below.

## Host and Guest Toolchains

The OpenVM Rust frontend supports the following host and guest toolchains:

- **Host**: `linux/amd64` with Rust 1.86.0: `rustc 1.86.0 (05f9846f8 2025-03-31)`
- **Guest**: `riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf` with Rust `nightly-2025-02-14`: `rustc 1.86.0-nightly (a567209da 2025-02-13)`

The `riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf` guest target incorporates special support for
zkVMs and has official support by the 
[Rust toolchain](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/riscv32im-risc0-zkvm-elf.html).
We anticipate upstreaming an OpenVM-specific target to Rust in the future.

:::info
We use a nightly Rust toolchain for the guest target in order to support compiling
`std` crates in a way compatible with zkVM usage.

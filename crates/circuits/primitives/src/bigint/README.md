# BigInt modular arithmetic by checking carry to zero

## Context

In general we need to work with BigUints, which we say consist of representations via `limbs: [F; num_limbs]` where the unsigned integer equals $`\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \texttt{limbs}[i] \cdot 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits} \cdot i}`$. In the canonical form we assume `limbs[i]` in $`[0, 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}})`$ (unsigned `limb_bits` bits).

The key optimization is to allow representations of BigInts as `OverflowInts` with `limbs[F; num_limbs]`
where `limbs[i]` in $`[-2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}}, 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}})`$.
The integer equals $`\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \texttt{limbs}[i] \cdot 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits} \cdot i}`$.

The core functionality that is needed is `check_carry_to_zero`: which is the constraint that given OverflowInt limbs, you can constrain the corresponding integer equals 0. This is done by a sequence of carries to get the overflow integer into canonical form (and check it's zero). The carries must be range checked to be limb_bits.

The use case is commonly if we have multiple OverflowInts `a,b,p,q,r` we may want to check
`check_carry_to_zero(a * b + p * q - r)` where `a * b` is expanded bigint multiplication, but without carries. Observe this proves `a * b = r (mod p)`.

We decided that `check_carry_to_zero` should not be a separate AIR that receives interactions:
the reason is that you would need to receive all the limbs on this AIR which duplicates the total number of cells by quite a lot.
We also discussed that `limb_bits` should be ~10 to handle 256-bit integers, and it is not worth using a large `limb_bits` and then decomposing to smaller chunks for the carries, because then you need to do further range checks on the decomposition.

## Implementation details

### Assumptions
* Inputs `x, y` are of the same length (when represented as limbs) as `p`. They don't necessarily be within `[0, p)`.

### `OverflowInt<T>`

It's big integer represented as limbs, and also tracks the value limit of each limb.
- it supports arithmetic like +-*, and updates the value limit accordingly.
- the generic type can be real values like `isize` or expression like `AB::Expr`.
- can generate the carries array for the limbs automatically.

This overflow representation is useful for optimizing constraints in intermediate calculations, allowing us to store results of operations without immediately performing carry propagation. Essentially, each limb can store intermediate results of arithmetic operations before normalizing to canonical form.

Use case:

1. Trace generation: The parent AIR (e.g. multiplication AIR) can compose the expression (e.g. AB - PQ - R) as `OverflowInt<isize>` and generates the carries array (see the tests for an example).
1. AIR eval: The parent AIR `eval` function should compose the expression as `OverflowInt<AB::Expr>` and pass it to the check carry subair `constrain_carry_to_zero` along with the carries column.

### Limit of Overflow Bits

To ensure each overflow limb has a unique representation in the field, we need to guarantee that the negative values don't overlap with the positive values after being mapped into the field. This leads to the constraint on `overflow_bits`:

```math
\begin{align}
p - 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}} &> 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}} - 1 \\
p - 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}} &\geq 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}} \\
2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits}+1} &\leq p \\
\texttt{overflow\_bits} &\leq \lfloor\log_2(p)\rfloor - 1
\end{align}
```

This ensures that when we store negative values as field elements (by adding the field modulus), they remain distinct from positive values, allowing for unique representation of all possible limb values within the field.

### Range checker bit v.s. OverflowInt bit limit

There is a subtle difference between the `max_overflow_bits` tracked within `OverflowInt`, and the bit we range check.

`OverflowInt` starts from something nonnegative like a `BigUint` or `AB::Var`,
and we keep track of the maximum absolute value of each element (and the `max_overflow_bits = ceil_log2(max_abs)` ).
Each supported operation (namely +-*) updates the max abs value.

Given an OverflowInt with `max_overflow_bits = m`, and assume the non-overflow limb bits is `k`.
The positive carry is at most `m - k` bits. And since the negative carry is rounding down (see below section) it's at most (in the abs sense) `-2^(m-k)`.
So the range of carry should be $`[-2^{m-k}, 2^{m-k})`$. The way we range-check this is by adding $`2^{m-k}`$ to it so it's within $`[0, 2^{m-k+1})`$ and this within `m-k+1` bits.

### Negative carries

Assume the limb bit (not overflowed) is `k`, and one of the expr of `OverflowInt` is evaluated to `X = -( 2^k * a + b)`.
If `b = 0` (which is usually the case as this subair is used to constrain something evaluated to 0), then carry is exactly `-a` without worrying about taking floor or ceil.
However, to make it complete let's assume b is not 0. Since the canonical limb is nonnegative within $`[0, 2^k - 1)`$,
the carry should be `-(a+1)` with canonical limb `2^k - b`.
Therefore the correct way to calculate carry is `X >> k` instead of `X / (1 << K)`.

```Rust
fn main() {
    let val: isize = 63;
    assert_eq!(val >> 2, 15);
    assert_eq!(val / 4, 15);
    let val2: isize = -63;
    assert_eq!(val2 >> 2, -16);  // >> round toward -inf
    assert_eq!(val2 / 4, -15);   // / round toward 0
}
```

### Different AIRs for each operation v.s. single AIR for all operations

Assuming the modulus prime is of N limbs.
For multiplication, the columns are: `x, y, q, r` of size N, and `carries` of size 2N-1 (as `x*y` can be of length 2N-1).
Division is just a different equation: `yr - x - pq = 0`, so the same columns work.
For addition and subtractions: `x [+/-] y - r - pq = 0` , the main difference here is that we know that `q` will just be one limb,
and thus the equation should have limb size N, and `carries` just be of size N.
If we combine the operations into one chip, we will also need extra columns: `opcode_add_flag, opcode_sub_flag. opcode_mul_flag , opcode_div_flag`.
Therefore we will just have separate chips for different operations.

We are unsure if division is actually needed, so commented out for now.

## Note on `is_valid` boolean check

Both the `CheckCarryModToZeroSubAir` and `CheckCarryToZeroSubAir` subair's do not assert that `is_valid` is boolean.
They assume the parent air already does this.

This is to avoid duplicating the `is_valid` boolean check every time we use these subair's, since we may call `CheckCarryModToZeroSubAir::eval` multiple times in the parent air's `eval` method.

## SubAir Constraint Details

### CheckCarryToZeroSubAir

This SubAir constrains that a given overflow limb representation of an integer is zero by taking the carries as hint, range-checking that they are valid, verifying they are correct, and ensuring the final carry is zero.

**IO Columns:**
- `is_valid`: Boolean selector $`s`$ indicating whether the row is a real (non-padding) row
- `limbs`: Array of overflow limbs representing a big integer $`[a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}]`$

**Aux Columns:**
- `carries`: Array of carries $`[c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{n-1}]`$ for converting overflow limbs to canonical representation, allowed to be negative and within the range $`[-2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits}}, 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits}})`$

**Constraints:**

To range check the carries within the range $`-2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits}} \leq c_i < 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits}}`$, we add $`2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits}}`$ to both sides of the range to make the range check from 0 to some value, only when selector is on.

```math
0 \leq c_i + 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits}} < 2^{\texttt{overflow\_bits} - \texttt{limb\_bits} + 1}
```

We check the carries are calculated correctly and the integer represented by the limbs is zero.

```math
\begin{align}
a_0 &= c_0 \cdot 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}} & &\hspace{2em} (1)\\
a_i + c_{i-1} &= c_i \cdot 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}} & \forall\ 0 < i < N &\hspace{2em} (2)\\
c_{N-1} &= 0 & &\hspace{2em} (3)
\end{align}
```

What this is demonstrating is that there exists an array of carries $`[c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_{n-1}]`$ which represent the carries for converting overflow limbs to canonical representation such that the canonical representation of the integer is zero.

### CheckCarryModToZeroSubAir

This SubAir constrains that a given overflow limb representation of an integer equals zero modulo another integer (i.e., x - q * m = 0).

**IO Columns:**
- `is_valid`: Boolean selector $`s`$ indicating whether the row is a real (non-padding) row
- `limbs`: Array of overflow limbs representing the integer $`[a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}]`$

**Aux Columns:**
- `quotient`: Array of quotient limbs $`[q_0, q_1, \ldots, q_{n-1}]`$
- `carries`: Array of carries for converting the remainder to canonical form

**Constraints:**

We range check the quotient to be a valid signed `limb_bit` representation i.e. $`-2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}} \leq q_i < 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}}`$. To range check within this range, we add $`2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}}`$ to both sides to make the range check from 0 to some value, only when selector is on. Quotient can be negative.

```math
0 \leq q_i + 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}} < 2^{\texttt{limb\_bits}+1}
```

Finally, we calculate the remainder limbs $`[r_0, r_1, \ldots, r_{n-1}]`$ where $`r_i = a_i - q_i * m_i`$ and constrain it to 0.

```math
\begin{align}
\texttt{CheckCarryToZero}(a - q * m) & &\hspace{2em} (1)
\end{align}
```

What this is demonstrating is that there exists a quotient $`q`$ such that $`a - q * m = 0`$.

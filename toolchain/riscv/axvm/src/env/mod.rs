//! Functions for interacting with the host environment.
//!
//! The zkVM provides a set of functions to perform operations that manage
//! execution, I/O, and proof composition. The set of functions related to each
//! of these operations are described below.
//!
//! ## System State
//!
//! The guest has some control over the execution of the zkVM by pausing or
//! exiting the program explicitly. This can be achieved using the [pause] and
//! [exit] functions.
//!
//! ## Proof Verification
//!
//! The zkVM supports verification of RISC Zero [receipts] in a guest program,
//! enabling [proof composition]. This can be achieved using the [verify()] and
//! [verify_integrity] functions.
//!
//! ## Input and Output
//!
//! The zkVM provides a set of functions for handling input, public output, and
//! private output. This is useful when interacting with the host and committing
//! to some data publicly.
//!
//! The zkVM provides functions that automatically perform (de)serialization on
//! types and, for performance reasons, there is also a `_slice` variant that
//! works with raw slices of plain old data. Performing operations on slices is
//! more efficient, saving cycles during execution and consequently producing
//! smaller proofs that are faster to produce. However, the `_slice` variants
//! can be less ergonomic, so consider trade-offs when choosing between the two.
//! For more information about guest optimization, see RISC Zero's [instruction
//! on guest optimization][guest-optimization]
//!
//! Convenience functions to read and write to default file descriptors are
//! provided. See [read()], [write()], [self::commit] (and their `_slice`
//! variants) for more information.
//!
//! In order to access default file descriptors directly, see [stdin], [stdout],
//! [stderr] and [journal]. These file descriptors are either [FdReader] or
//! [FdWriter] instances, which can be used to read from or write to the host.
//! To read from or write into them, use the [Read] and [Write] traits.
//!
//! WARNING: Specifying a file descriptor with the same value of a default file
//! descriptor is not recommended and may lead to unexpected behavior. A list of
//! default file descriptors can be found in the [fileno] module.
//!
//! ## Utility
//!
//! The zkVM provides utility functions to log messages to the debug console and
//! to measure the number of processor cycles that have occurred since the guest
//! began. These can be achieved using the [log] and [cycle_count] functions.

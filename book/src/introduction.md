# Introduction

OpenVM is ...

... is _modular_, which means that its functionality is provided by several independent components. In particular, one can expand the functionality of OpenVM by adding new components.

An _extension_ (we could also call it a _module_ but we prefer not to in order to avoid confusion with the concept of a _module_ in the Rust language) is a component that provides a specific functionality. It consists of the following parts:

- one
- two
- three

...

The next chapters are supposed to serve as a manual for using this modularity.

# In particular, Chapter 2 is for this, Chapter 3 is for that, et cetera.
